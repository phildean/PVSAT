# Long PVSAT Behavioural (or EEG)

12 Blocks; 60 Trials/block (20 Target); 4 Conditions (ISI: 2.5s, 2s, 1.5s, 1s)

Stimuli are single digit numbers: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

Stimulus: 500ms

_Single digit numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive are presented on the screen one at a time, with 60 of these stimuli (including 20 randomly ordered target stimuli) per block. There are four conditions: 2.5 s PVSAT, 2 s PVSAT, 1.5 s PVSAT, and 1 s PVSAT. The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) is 2.5 s, 2 s, 1.5 s, or 1 s. Each of the four ISI's is presented with each of the three target numbers. Participants are required to add the number on screen to the previously presented number. At the beginning of each block they are given a target number of 9, 10, or 11. If the addition equalled the target number, a “correct” response is required. An “incorrect” response is required for every other addition.The response keys are M and C on a standard keyboard._  


Can be used with EEG, and sends parallel port codes:

	1s Target (9 as target)          31 
	1s Target (10 as target)         32
	1s Target (11 as target)         33
	1.5s Target (9 as target)        34 
	1.5s Target (10 as target)       35
	1.5s Target (11 as target)       36
	2s Target (9 as target)          37 
	2s Target (10 as target)         38
	2s Target (11 as target)         39
	2.5s Target (9 as target)        40 
	2.5s Target (10 as target)       41
	2.5s Target (11 as target)       42
	1s Non-Target (9 as target)      11
