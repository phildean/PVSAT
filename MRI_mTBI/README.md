_The PVSAT has four conditions (2.5 sec PVSAT, 2 sec PVSAT, 1.5 sec PVSAT, 1 sec PVSAT). The paradigm is a block design, with 12 blocks containing three randomly ordered repetitions of the four conditions. Task‐related blocks start with an information screen detailing the difficulty level of the upcoming block presented for 1–3 sec (jittered) and are alternated with 20s rest blocks (white crosshair in center of black screen). A feedback screen is presented after each block detailing participant's performance. The response keys were right index or middle fingers on an fMRI compatible button box._
